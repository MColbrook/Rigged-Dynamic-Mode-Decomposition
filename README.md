# Rigged-Dynamic-Mode-Decomposition
Code for riggedDMD: generalized eigenfunction expansions (and spectral measures) of Koopman operators

Computation of generalized eigenfunctios and spectral measures of Koopman operators associated with discrete-time autonomous dynamical systems.
The code includes **"main_routines"** and a gallery of examples.

For a pedagogical review of DMD methods, including code, see the repository: https://github.com/MColbrook/DMD-Multiverse
